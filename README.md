Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

Part I: Gutenberg Changes
====================

I moved the styles from the HTML file into
an external CSS file which all three of the files
are styled by. 

I then chose one standard font-family plus a 
yellowish old paper background for the webpage. 

For the paragraph styling, I made it have a text-indent
since many books have that typically. 

For the header tags, I ranked them by size using
font-size and font-weight (with h1 and h2 being the biggest and heaviest). 

For the img tags, I made them centered to the webpage and also bordered with a brown outline then a slight box-shadow. 
====================
