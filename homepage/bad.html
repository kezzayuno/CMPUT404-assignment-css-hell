            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I am a fifth year at the University of Alberta double majoring in Computing Science and Psychology. I love integrating 
                psychological concepts in Computer Science (vice versa). I enjoy learning new things, so I try to expand my horizons as much as possible!
                I have worn many hats throughout my academic journey such as: lab programmer, researcher, data analyst assistant, behavioral analyst assistant, 
                project developer, teacher assistant, tech lead, and technical writer intern. I am an extremely hard working and ambitious person 
                with a strong emphasis at meeting deadlines!

                <p>
                    I am currently a CMPUT 174 Teacher Assistant (TA). I have worked under Professor Ildar, Professor Sadaf, and Professor Morris.
                    I have learned so much more about Python and the typical pitfalls that students fall for. This experience not only helped students
                    learn Python, but it also helped me hone my skills related to Python.

                <p>
                    I was DigitalOcean's technical writer intern during their four month internship program. I was able to write 186 articles within
                    four months and further developed a glossary section within their Product Documentation. I was able to test and implement a potential
                    hover tool that previews different articles within the Product Documentation to encourage exploration and learning.

                <p>
                    I was a behavioral and analytical research assistant for Dr. Reyhaneh. Behavioral research consisted of conducting tests with
                    participants and collecting data. Analytical research assistance consisted of data processing and extraction using Python and
                    MATLAB. I had analzyed eyetracking, brainwave, and behavioral data through this project.

                <p>
                    I worked under Dr. Caplan and studied why order is difficult to remember compared to associative memory. I conducted several 
                    experiments under the supervisor of Dr. Caplan and his graduate student, Jeremy Thomas. We ended up publishing a paper that 
                    discusses our findings related to order memory and associative memory (and their implications on mathematical models of 
                    memory): <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-022-01347-6">The relationship between interactive imagery

            <h2>What I can offer!</h2>
            <p>
                I can offer many assets to your team by providing a perspective in technology that puts the user's behaviors and attitudes 
                first. By doing so, we can create more mindful products. I am also an extremely hardworking person that is willing to put in the 
                work to only hit those deadlines but to also create great products.
